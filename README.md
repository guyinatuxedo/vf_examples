## vf_examples

So this repo is supposed to be examples of using `vf` to generate format strings. You can find `vf` at `https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/vf`.

```
backdoor17_bbpwn	-	32 bit with alignment and printed bytes
vf_64				-	64 bit binary
vf_pie				-	32 bit with value and address bases
pico18_echo			-	32 bit leak with "%s"
angstrum_format1	-	64 bit binary
```
